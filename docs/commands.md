# Command reference

Run `steck <command>`. Global flags: `-h/--help`, `-v/--version`.

Most commands act on the **current branch** — resolved from the worktree you're in (the directory
containing `steckling.yml`, searched upward). `new`, and the `[branch]` argument on some commands,
let you act on another branch by name.

---

### `steck new <branch> [base]`

Create a git worktree for a new branch and allocate its service ports (recorded in the registry).

- `base` — branch to fork from (default: `worktrees.base`, usually `main`). Uses `origin/<base>`
  if it exists, else the local `<base>`.
- The worktree is created at `worktrees.dir/<branch>` (default `../<repo>-trees/<branch>`).
- Files listed in `worktrees.copyOnCreate` are copied in (gitignored local files a fresh worktree
  lacks, e.g. `.env.local`).

Flags:

- `--up` — bring services up immediately after creating.
- `--no-run` — with `--up`, bring services up but don't run the app.

```sh
steck new feature/PLA-123
steck new hotfix/login main --up --no-run
```

---

### `steck up [--no-run] [--reprovision]`

Bring up the current branch's stack and run the app.

1. Resolve/allocate host ports (reusing the registry's record so they're stable).
2. `docker compose up --wait` (waits for healthchecks).
3. Write `.steckling/env`.
4. Run the `provision` hook **if this is the first boot** (tracked by `.steckling/.provisioned`).
5. Run `app.run` in the foreground.

Flags:

- `--no-run` — do everything except step 5 (leave the stack up, don't start the app).
- `--reprovision` — run the `provision` hook again even if already provisioned.

---

### `steck down`

Stop the current branch's containers (`docker compose stop`). **Keeps volumes and data** — frees
memory. Resume with `steck up`.

---

### `steck exec -- <command> [args…]`

Run any command with the current branch's `.steckling/env` loaded.

```sh
steck exec -- psql $DATABASE_URL
steck exec -- npm run migration:revert
```

Requires `steck up` to have been run at least once (so `.steckling/env` exists).

---

### `steck list`

Table of every registered worktree: branch, live status (`up`/`stopped`/`down`), host ports, and
path. `(missing)` flags a worktree whose folder is gone. Status is reconciled against Docker.

---

### `steck status [branch]`

Detail for one worktree — branch, compose project, status, ports, the `.steckling/env` path, and
last-used time. Defaults to the current branch; pass a branch name to inspect another.

---

### `steck rm [branch] [--yes] [--force]`

Destroy a branch's stack: removes its containers, **named volumes (data loss)**, and registry
entry. Leaves the worktree folder and git branch intact.

- `--yes`/`-y` — skip the confirmation prompt (required when non-interactive).
- `--force` — allow removing the base branch's stack (refused by default).
- `[branch]` — target another branch without checking it out (defaults to current).

```sh
steck rm feature/PLA-123 --yes
```

To also remove the folder + branch afterwards:
`git worktree remove <path> && git branch -D <branch>`.

---

### `steck prune [--yes]`

Find worktrees whose branch is **merged into base**, **deleted**, or whose **folder is missing**,
and reclaim their stacks (containers + volumes + registry entry). Lists candidates first; pass
`--yes` to skip the prompt. Leaves folders and branches intact.

---

### `steck deploy [--dry-run] [--status]`

Ship the current branch's **agent** to Railway as a long-running or scheduled service. Requires
`agent`/`deploy` blocks in `steckling.yml` and the `railway` CLI, authenticated — see
[Deploy to Railway](deploy-railway.md).

1. Generate `railway.json` from the `agent` block (build + start command + optional cron).
2. Provision `deploy.needs` databases; push `deploy.env` variables (secrets via `--stdin`).
3. `railway up` to build the Dockerfile and deploy.

Flags:

- `--dry-run` — print the generated `railway.json` and the command plan; execute nothing.
- `--status` — show the recorded deployment (project, kind, last deploy) instead of deploying.

---

### `steck logs [-n N] [--build]`

Tail the deployed agent's logs (`railway logs`). `-n N` limits to the last N lines; `--build`
shows build logs instead of runtime logs.

---

### `steck destroy [--yes]`

Tear down the current branch's Railway deployment (`railway down`). The **local** stack and git
worktree are left untouched. `--yes`/`-y` skips the confirmation prompt (required when
non-interactive).

---

### `steck mcp`

Start the stdio [MCP](mcp.md) server — exposes the fleet to agents as tools + the
`steckling://registry` resource. Usually launched by your MCP client, not by hand.

---

### `steck config`

Validate `steckling.yml` and print the fully-resolved config (with defaults filled in). Useful for
debugging the config or seeing what Steckling will use.

---

### `steck doctor`

Pre-flight check: bun, git, the Docker daemon, `docker compose`, the `railway` CLI (a warning if
absent — it's only needed for `steck deploy`), and whether a valid `steckling.yml` is present.
Exits non-zero if a hard requirement fails.
